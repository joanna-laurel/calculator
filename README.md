Foundations Course capstone | The Odin Project


## Description
This app is the capstone project for The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The assignment is to combine basic HTML, CSS, and JS to create a functional, user-friendly calculator interface. This is the first project in the curriculum TOP identifies as maybe worthy of being a portfolio piece, so I guess it's time to get serious about my README files.

## Details

#### Calculator design features:
- (very understated) cat theme, because cats are always appropriate
- possibly one too many colors but I like them all! how do I choose!
- very lengthy calculation entries disappear off right side of display as you type, creating a nice "follow along" effect without weird text contortions or visual spillage
- when you hit "=" you see the entire calculation a.k.a. " 5 x 1000 = 5000" if it fits in the display---otherwise you just see the solution
- buttons have proper old-school divide and multiply symbols versus keyboard "*" and "/"

#### Calculator functionality:
- essential calculator stuff: add, subtract, multiply, divide, equals, clear, digits 0-9, decimal point
- backspace button for clearing one digit/operator at a time
- positive/negative number toggle button (kind of boring, considering other options)
- capacity to handle very large and very small numbers
- rounds to seven decimal places, which seems generously precise for the casual calculator user
- option to start next calculation by clicking a new operator or number button vs. extra step of clearing with AC button
- polite reminder that you can't divide by zero

#### Programming stuff I nailed down during this project:
- batch processing event listeners efficiently
- making code very concise but hopefully still readable with ternary operators
- using arrays to good effect to store and manipulate temporary inputs

#### Features and functionality left to add:
- mobile-friendly interface
- keyboard support


## Project reflections
Most of the logic for this was surprisingly easy and writing the functions came pretty naturally, which is encouraging considering JavaScript was a daunting and mysterious beast about a month ago. I could play around tweaking the calculator for days and I could add a zillion more buttons for fancy math stuff, but I think it's solid for what it is and I'm ready to move on. Maybe I will come back and make it more fun and exciting and cat-infused later.
